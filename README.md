R functions to create time series BUGS models of various order.

At the moment function available to create standard AR models with extensions for non-constant variance (stochastic volatility models and random variance shift models).

Given time, I am going to try to expand to

  1) Full ARIMA models
  2) MV models (VAR) and some extensions (SV)

Collaborators Welcome.
