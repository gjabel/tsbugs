R functions tto create time series BUGS models of various order.

At the moement function availbe to create stadard AR models with extentions for non-constant variance (stochastic volatility models and random variance shift models).

Given time, I am going to try to exapand

1) Full ARIMA models
1) MV models (VAR) and some extenstions (SV)
